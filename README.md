## Run

1) npm install
2) npm start
The webiste will be running locally on localhost:3000

## Test

1) npm run test

## Coverage

1) npm run coverage
2) Go to coverages sub-folder in your directory, then to 'lcov-report' and then copy the path of index.html file.
3) Paste the path on any browser and you will be able tos ee the coverage report.

## Elements that exemplify my proficiency

1) An atmoic structure design that will help to accomodate further changes in the website without any additional cost in having to change the entire website.
2) Handling error in api calls and showing the user that there has been an error and he needs to retry.
Thus, at no point user interaction is compromised.
3) The user design is interactive from the user interaction point of view. 
For example, in the search box as soon as he goes on typing, the list of upcoming movies is filtered side-by-side and not waiting for him to press 'Enter'.
4) A loader is shown to the user whenever API calls are being made to let him know things are being processed, rather than showing him a blank screen during the process. 
5) Used React Hooks, a completely new feature of React, that further reduces the system size and helps to increase the performance.
6) Used SCSS, thus also making sure the css is also re-usable across components and within the same component as well.
7) Unit testing of almost 100%, shows my proficiency in testing the components and thus reducing errors to a minimal.
8) API version and base url constants, so that if at any time the url or api version changes, I would have to just change it at one place and not anywhere anytime in future.

## Things I could have done

1) To try and make testing coverage to 100%. This will reduce the probability of errors close to 0.

## Feedback

To design UI screens in FIGMA or ZEPLIN, that makes it easy for development.
